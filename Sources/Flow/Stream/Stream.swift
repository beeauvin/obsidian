/// A communication pathway with built-in bidirectional lifecycle awareness. Built on
/// `Channel` primitives for high-performance message delivery.
///
/// `Stream` extends Obsidian's messaging architecture by providing a connection between
/// components with mutual awareness of lifecycle events. Unlike a regular `Channel`,
/// which offers simple fire-and-forget messaging, a `Stream` establishes a
/// relationship where both ends can be notified when either side releases the connection.
///
/// Streams can be used directly through the Channeling interface:
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create a stream with data and lifecycle handlers
/// let resource_stream = Stream(
///   source_released: { released_pulse in
///     // Handle source closing the stream
///     await resource_service.disconnect_source()
///   },
///   anchor_released: { released_pulse in
///     // Handle anchor closing the stream
///     await resource_service.release_resources()
///   },
///   handler: { pulse in
///     // Process data flowing through the stream
///     await resource_service.process(pulse.data)
///   }
/// )
///
/// // Send data through the stream
/// let result = await resource_stream.send(data_pulse)
///
/// // Release the stream when no longer needed
/// await resource_stream.release()
/// ```
final public actor Stream<Data: Pulsable>: Streaming {
  /// Unique identifier for this stream
  public let id: UUID = UUID()

  // Primary data channel from source to sink
  private var data_channel: Optional<Channel<Data>>

  // Source closure notification channel
  private var source_released_channel: Optional<Channel<StreamReleased>>

  // Anchor closure notification channel
  private var anchor_released_channel: Optional<Channel<StreamReleased>>

  /// Creates a new stream with the specified handlers.
  ///
  /// This initializer establishes the three internal channels that form the stream's
  /// communication infrastructure:
  /// - A data channel for the primary message flow
  /// - Optional notification channels for lifecycle events
  ///
  /// The notification channels are only created if handlers are provided, allowing
  /// for efficient resource usage when full bidirectional awareness isn't needed.
  /// Each notification channel is dedicated to a specific direction of release
  /// notification, ensuring clear separation of concerns and predictable behavior.
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// // Create a stream with both lifecycle handlers
  /// let full_stream = Stream(
  ///   source_released: { released_pulse in
  ///     handle_source_disconnect()
  ///   },
  ///   anchor_released: { released_pulse in
  ///     handle_anchor_disconnect()
  ///   },
  ///   handler: message_processor.handle
  /// )
  ///
  /// // Create a stream with only source release notification
  /// let source_aware_stream = Stream(
  ///   source_released: { released_pulse in handle_source_disconnect() },
  ///   handler: message_processor.handle
  /// )
  ///
  /// // Create a simple stream with no lifecycle awareness
  /// let simple_stream = Stream(
  ///   handler: message_processor.handle
  /// )
  /// ```
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - source_released: Optional handler notified when source closes the stream
  ///   - anchor_released: Optional handler notified when anchor closes the stream
  ///   - handler: Handler that processes data flowing from source to anchor

  /// Sends data from the source to the sink.
  ///
  /// This method forwards the provided pulse to the stream's internal data channel
  /// for processing by the registered data handler. It follows the fire-and-forget
  /// pattern, but with additional checking for stream release status.
  ///
  /// If the stream has been released (data_channel is nil), the method immediately
  /// returns a failure result without attempting to send the pulse. This behavior
  /// ensures that attempts to use a released stream produce consistent, predictable
  /// responses rather than unexpected errors.
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// // Send a data pulse through the stream
  /// let result = await stream.send(data_pulse)
  ///
  /// // Check if the stream was available
  /// if case .failure(.released) = result {
  ///   // Handle the case where the stream was already released
  ///   recreate_stream_connection()
  /// }

  /// - Returns: A result indicating success or a specific stream error

  /// Releases the stream, preventing further pulse processing.
  ///
  /// This method performs a complete shutdown of the stream by:
  /// 1. Checking if the stream is already released (data_channel is nil)
  /// 2. Sending release notifications through both notification channels (if they exist)
  ///    including the stream's unique ID both directly and via metadata
  /// 3. Clearing all channel references to allow proper resource cleanup
  ///
  /// The release process follows a careful sequence to ensure that all notifications
  /// are sent before the data channel is cleared, providing connected components
  /// with an opportunity to react to the stream closure.
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// // Release a stream when it's no longer needed
  /// let result = await stream.release()
  ///

  ///   // Stream was successfully released
