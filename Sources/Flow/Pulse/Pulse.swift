import ObsidianFoundation

/// A lightweight, type-safe message container for async communication.
///
/// `Pulse` is the core message unit in the Obsidian system, encapsulating
/// typed data along with metadata that provides operational context. Pulses
/// can form causal chains to track related messages and maintain tracing
/// information across the system.
///
/// Pulses are immutable, with all modifications creating new instances through
/// the fluent builder pattern. This ensures thread safety when passing messages
/// across actor boundaries.
///
/// Example usage:
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create a simple pulse with default metadata
/// let login_event = UserLoggedIn(user_id: user.id)
/// let pulse = Pulse(login_event)
///
/// // Create a pulse with custom metadata
/// let enhanced_pulse = pulse
///   .priority(.high)
///   .tagged("auth", "security")
///   .from(auth_service)
///
/// // Create a response pulse that maintains causal chain
/// let response_pulse = Pulse(AuthenticationCompleted(success: true))
///   .echoes(enhanced_pulse)
/// ```
///
/// `Pulse` conforms to both `Pulsable` and `Representable`, ensuring it can safely
/// traverse actor boundaries and providing identity information for logging and debugging.
