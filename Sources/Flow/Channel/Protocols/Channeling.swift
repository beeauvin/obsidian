/// A protocol that defines the core operations for channel-like components.
///
/// `Channeling` standardizes the interface for any component that provides
/// channel-like functionality, whether directly implementing a channel or
/// wrapping one. This allows for consistent usage patterns and enables
/// composition and delegation without tight coupling to the concrete `Channel` type.
///
/// The protocol focuses on the essential operation of message delivery:
/// - Send a strongly-typed pulse to a handler
///
/// Lifecycle management is handled through Swift's standard reference counting,
/// making the interface simple and predictable.
///
/// ```swift
/// struct ChannelWrapper<Data: Pulsable>: Channeling {
///   private let inner_channel: Channel<Data>
///
///   init(handler: @escaping ChannelHandler<Data>) {
///     self.inner_channel = Channel(handler: handler)
///   }
///
///   func send(_ pulse: Pulse<Data>) async {
///     await inner_channel.send(pulse)
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This protocol enables building more complex channel-based architectures
/// through composition and wrapping, while maintaining a consistent interface.
public protocol Channeling<Data> {
  /// The type of data this channel can handle
  associatedtype Data: Pulsable
  
  /// Sends a pulse to this channel for processing.
  ///
  /// - Parameter pulse: The typed pulse to send through this channel
  func send(_ pulse: Pulse<Data>)
